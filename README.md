# foxyjs

Unfinished project. Clojure-inspired lispy JS compiler thingy!

## Run tests

`npm test`

## Why make this?

Clojure is pretty awesome, as is ClojureScript, and learning them has really
helped me to grow as a developer.

That said, there are certain aspects of ClojureScript that I'm not too fond of.
Mainly, the compiler being part of the Java ecosystem and having to write
macros in Clojure instead of ClojureScript.

That got me thinking, and after exploring a few alternatives (LispyScript,
Wisp) I decided to explore the possibility of making my own lispy JS compiler.

## Why stop?

'Cause it's a mess!

Well, honestly I think it was going pretty well, actually. But it's not shaping
up to be the simple language that I had hoped for. I've already made a few
compromises that I'm not quite happy with.

This project will take a _lot_ of careful thought to get right, and I'm not at
a place in my life where I can spare the time and energy that it deserves.

I'd like to revisit this idea some day.
